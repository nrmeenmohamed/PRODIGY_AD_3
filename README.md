# Stopwatch App
Welcome to the Stopwatch App repository! This project is a simple, yet functional stopwatch built using Flutter. It was developed as the third task in my internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

- Pause: Temporarily stop the stopwatch without resetting the time.
- Resume: Continue timing from where it was paused.
- Reset: Set the elapsed time back to zero.
- Accurate Time Display: Shows time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
